<!--HTML5 semantic tags gives the browser details on the importatnce of each tag, that's important when using CSS and for accessibility reasons. We think the headings, for example h1, as well as asides, header/footer tags are useful. The browser displays elements in the same order as the document, but there are exceptions with nested elements. We learned how to create snippets in sublime, to help save time, and would definitley create snippets in the future to save time. Creating the snippet was the hardest concept since it was new, and we need to read more and just create more snippets to understand it well. -->
