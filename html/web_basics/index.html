	<h1>Hello world</h1>
	<p>My dog Lou may be the <strong>greatest</strong> rescue dog in the <em>history</em> of rescue dogs.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>He's the best cuddler.</li>
		<li>He has huge, sad, brown eyes.</li>
		<li>He loves to be inside, he's our indoor dog.
		<ol>
			<li>He was rescued as a stray, so we think that's why he hates the outdoors.</li>
			<li>His favorite spot in winter is right in front of the fire.</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<p>We adopted Lou from <a href="http://www.pawschicago.org/">Paws</a>, and highly recommend checking the organization out if you want to adopt a pet.</p>
