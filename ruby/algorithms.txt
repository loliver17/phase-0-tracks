Using an Elevator:

- Look at the address you are travelling to, and read the floor number.
- If no floor is listed, the suite/unit number indicates which floor. The 1st number indicates which floor for floors 1-9, and the 1st 2 numbers indicate which floor for floors 10-99. A '0' usually follows the floor number. 
- Determine which floor you are on by looking at the elevator frame.
- If the floor you need is a larger number than the floor you're currently on, hit the up button next to the elevator. If the floor you need is a smaller number than the floor you're currently on, hit the down button. 
- The button you hit will light up.
- Wait until the elevator door opens, and walk inside. 
- Hit the button of the floor you determined in the first step. The button will light up, and the doors will close.
- Once the doors reopen, and the elevator frame shows the same floor number you need, walk off the elevator.

Make Coffee:
