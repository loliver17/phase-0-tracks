# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
Version control is a system that records changes to folders/files, etc. and allows you to recall different versions later. It's useful to work on new ideas and test them, but be able to go back if they don't work out. You can find the bugs more easily. You're also able to see who made what changes, and when, to coordinate team projects. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch splits off from the master version. It's a clone of the master, but allows you to work on a new feature without compromising the master code. Once you know the feature work is complete you can merge it back into the master. You can have multiple branches at once for different features and different team members. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is recording a change to the repository. So if you first change a file and save it, you now need to commit that change to update the repository. A good commit message should be specific so any future user can understand what was changed.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when the master and branch cannot be merged back together due to an issue, such as different code changes on the same line and file in differnt branches. You must resolve a merge conflict in order to merge the branch and master back together.
